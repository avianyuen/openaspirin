1. Description: Give a description of what the step sequence will accomplish for the overall process in the main branch.
Sulfuric acid will be required to make materials for aspirin. Flue gas desulfurization from burning sulfur will convert it to calcium sulfate. Electrolysis of a solution of that and water will convert that to sulfuric acid.

2. Inputs: state the input vertices to the step sequence.
None

3. Outputs: state the output vertices to the step sequence.
Dirty sulfur powder

4. Procedure: describe step-by-step the procedure used to transform the inputs to the outputs.
    1. Scrape the side of a the ravine holding the sulfur spring water. There will be a soft solid deposit of dirty sulfur that should come off with anything harder than a plastic spoon.
    2. Dry the deposits gathered from step one so that the result is a dry powder.
    3. Crush the powder to homogenize.

5. Yield: state the purity of the output if applicable.
45.8±0.3% purity was deduced from hand-separating sulfur crystals when 2±1 g of dirty sulfur powder is recrystalized from 30±6 mL of mixed isomer xylenes. Resulting sulfur crystals are put into a 5 mm wide pile and pile length compared to an equally wide pile of dirt in the sample. 

6. Notes: state any other notes that are helpful to people
Yield is precise, but may not be accurate due to sources of error inherent in the pile-measuring technique described above (e.g. pile tapering).

7. Demonstration: Give a full YouTube link (not shortened) of a demonstration of the procedure above. You MUST include a demonstration before submitting a text file.
