1. Description:
Sulfuric acid will be required to make materials for aspirin. Flue gas desulfurization from burning sulfur will convert it to calcium sulfate. Electrolysis of a solution of that and water will convert that to sulfuric acid.

2. Inputs:
None

3. Outputs:
Dirty sulfur powder

4. Procedure:
    1. Scrape the side of a the ravine holding the sulfur spring water. There will be a soft solid deposit of dirty sulfur that should come off with anything harder than a plastic spoon.
    2. Dry the deposits gathered from step one so that the result is a dry powder.
    3. Crush the powder to homogenize.

5. Yield:
45.8±0.3% purity was deduced from hand-separating sulfur crystals when 2±1 g of dirty sulfur powder is recrystalized from 30±6 mL of mixed isomer xylenes. Resulting sulfur crystals are put into a 5 mm wide pile and pile length compared to an equally wide pile of dirt in the sample. 

6. Notes:
Yield is precise, but may not be accurate due to sources of error inherent in the pile-measuring technique described above (e.g. pile tapering).

7. Demonstration:
I (Avian Yuen) demonstrate the method and yield calculation myself (2021-06-07): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIT7tWOr4o
